# Memories
A Full Stack MERN Application for sharing and cherishing life's unforgettable moments.

## Introduction
Welcome to Memories, a social media platform that allows users to share and preserve their most cherished moments. Built using React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, this project demonstrates the core concepts of the MERN stack and shows how to build a dynamic full-stack application from scratch.

This project is based on a video tutorial series and serves as both a learning tool and a functional web application. By building Memories, I have strengthened my understanding of creating interactive, full-stack web applications and gained hands-on experience with MERN technologies.
